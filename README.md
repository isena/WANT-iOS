* It uses [AutoLayout](https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Introduction/Introduction.html) for a responsive user interface;

## Dev Settings

##### Do you WANT to run with stubs? 

In [```AppSetup.m```](./frontend/WANT/WANT/Setup/AppSetup.m) change

```objective-c
[self useStubs:NO];
```

to 

```objective-c
[self useStubs:YES];
```

## TODO

- Improve HTML to plain text parser;
- Support to other languages;
- Local caching.
